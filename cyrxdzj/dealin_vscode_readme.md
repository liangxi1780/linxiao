## The Repository

This repository ("`Code - OSS`") is where we (Microsoft) develop the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) product. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap), [monthly iteration plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans), and our [endgame plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Visual Studio Code

 
   
 

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` repository with Microsoft specific customizations released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) have their own repositories. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` provides rich language support for `JSON`.
