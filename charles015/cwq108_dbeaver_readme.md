## Running

DBeaver requires Java (JRE) 1.8+ to run.

*  Windows  and  MacOS X  installers include JRE so just use them and don't think about internals.
* On  Linux  you may need to install Java manually (usually by running `sudo apt-get install default-jre` or something similar).
* If you don't use installer (on Windows or Mac OS X) you may need to download Java (JDK) from  OpenJDK web site .
