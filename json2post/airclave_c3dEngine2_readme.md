c3dEngine2 is a cocos2d-x-like simple 3d game engine. it is the upgrade version of c3dEngine.  
  
support platform: iOS, win32  
language: c++  
  
c3dEngine2 is the upgrade version of c3dEngine.(c3dEngine, see: http://git.oschina.net/wantnon2/c3dEngine-superSingleCell or https://github.com/wantnon2/superSingleCell-c3dEngine )   
  
as i think c3dEngine is not very good in some aspects, so i am trying to make a better one. i will write a series of small samples to show each feature of the engine, and at the same time, refine the engine.  
now, the project is just start, so there is very few samples. but i will add more later.        
  
document:  
you can temporarily refer to the old version document, main concepts are same:   
http://git.oschina.net/wantnon2/c3dEngine-superSingleCell/wikis/home  
  
How to run the project:  
please see how_to_run_demos.txt under c3dEngine2/demos folder.    
  
possible issues and solution:  
assert failure on windows xp: http://git.oschina.net/wantnon2/c3dEngine2/issues/1  
install OpenAL before run demos on win32: http://git.oschina.net/wantnon2/c3dEngine2/issues/2    
  
i will update code to http://git.oschina.net/wantnon2/c3dEngine2.git and https://github.com/wantnon2/c3dEngine2, the former is the main site.
