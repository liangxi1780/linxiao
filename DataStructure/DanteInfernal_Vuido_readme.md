## Introduction

Vuido is a framework for creating native desktop applications based on Vue.js. Application using Vuido can run on Windows, OS X and Linux, using native GUI components, and don't require Electron.

Under the hood, Vuido uses the [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui) library which provides native GUI components for each desktop platform, and the [libui-node](https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node) bindings for Node.js.

## Acknowledgements

Vuido is largely based on Vue.js and shares most of its code, except for the platform specific code related to libui.

Vuido was inspired by [Proton Native](https://github.com/kusti8/proton-native), an environment for creating native desktop applications using React.
